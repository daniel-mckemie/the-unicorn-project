Full stack website for the restauarant S'Mac located in New York City.  Built in React, Bootstrap, JSS, MongoDB/Mongoose, Express, and Node.

The goal of the project was a full redesign of their original website, as well as implementing a full delivery system that can be run and maintained by the restaurant, having to bypass the fees and structures of third party delivery services such as Grubhub, Seamless, Uber Eats, etc.

Designed and written in collaboration with UX Designers Valerie Berke, Danielle Boris, and Marc Chicoine; and fellow Web Developer Arthur Bernier Jr.  This was all done in part of a project at General Assembly NYC.
